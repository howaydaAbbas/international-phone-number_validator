# internationa_phone_number_validator

1- Once the project is ready, inside folder internationa_phone_number_validator open the CMD and run docker-compose up --build

2- After app_server_1 and app_client_1 are up, go to http://localhost:3000/

3- Please notice that I've configured port 8080 for the backend service and port 3000 for the frontend service. Also I included a liquibase script to insert the regular expressions.

4- That's all for now , if you faced any unexpected error , contact me on howayda.gamal@gmail.com
